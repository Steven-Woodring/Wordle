## Overview
#### Wordle, the latest internet craze, is a daily online word game in which players have a maximum of 6 guesses to land on a specific 5-letter word. My Wordle Solver webpage identifies the 10 best starting words, scores them based on how much information they are expected to reveal to the player, and charts how well they have performed at solving past games.
